# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Utilized **Competitive Analysis** to reveal information about how we can improve our UI and UX feel without needing to start from scratch. Gave us a nice basis to go off of when beginning to create our digital representations
* Began **Sketches and Diagrams**. This is to help our dev team figure out their **MVP** for our first sprint and give them a rough outline on what needs to be done, and what the general layout is going to look like.
* Increased depth and breadth of **User Stories**, figuring out that our target audience is going to be 18-30 year olds, who are moving to a new town or in need of friends. This included Brainstorming multiple personal and non-personal user stories for active development.
* Understood that the **Aesthetic** of our app should come first and foremost as most people will delete the app if it looks bad or doesnt feel good enough to use
* **Heuristic Evaluation** of a close competitor gave us confidence that our app will work much better than their clunky piece of SAAS.
