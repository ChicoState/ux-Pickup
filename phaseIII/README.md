# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods
During the final phase of Pickup’s development process, we focused heavily on refining our wireframes to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. This involved enhancing visual elements, improving layout consistency, and ensuring all interactions aligned with user expectations. Each iteration was evaluated for usability and aesthetic appeal, making sure the design elements adhered to core usability principles. By consistently updating these wireframes, we were able to visualize the evolving structure and functionality of the app while keeping user engagement at the forefront.

To enhance the value of our wireframes, we developed a working prototype that added interactivity to static designs. This step allowed us to simulate real user interactions, providing a clearer sense of how users would navigate the final app. Through this process, we assessed the functionality of key features and ensured they were intuitive and accessible. The working prototype became an invaluable tool for identifying potential issues early, allowing for quick adjustments and improvements before investing in full development.

We maintained a cyclical process of prototyping and refining, which ensured continual improvement of both user engagement and heuristic quality. Each refinement cycle was informed by feedback gathered during informal walkthroughs and team evaluations. This iterative approach ensured that our design stayed user-centered, meeting both aesthetic and functional standards. Ultimately, the refined wireframes and prototypes formed a solid foundation for a user-friendly and visually appealing application.

Prototype Testing Protocol
To ensure that our prototype testing was systematic and insightful, we developed a comprehensive protocol outlining all the questions and prompts we would use during user testing. This protocol included detailed scenarios and tasks for participants to complete, helping us observe how they interacted with the app. By establishing clear guidelines, we ensured consistency across testing sessions, which made it easier to compare results and identify patterns. The questions focused on areas such as ease of navigation, clarity of design, and overall user satisfaction, providing a well-rounded assessment of the app’s functionality.

Our protocol also included specific prompts to encourage users to think aloud as they completed tasks. This approach allowed us to gather qualitative data on users’ thought processes, revealing insights into their expectations and frustrations. The structured nature of the protocol enabled us to maintain a neutral stance during testing, reducing bias and ensuring that participants’ responses were authentic. Additionally, the protocol was designed to adapt to user feedback in real-time, allowing us to explore unexpected areas of interest that arose during testing sessions.

By adhering to this structured protocol, we were able to gather valuable user knowledge and findings that directly informed our design improvements. The feedback highlighted both strengths and weaknesses of our prototype, helping us fine-tune elements to better meet user needs. This systematic approach ensured that our testing phase was both thorough and productive, ultimately contributing to a more polished and user-friendly final product.

User Testing and Feedback Analysis
The user testing phase was the culmination of our prototyping efforts and provided a critical opportunity to validate our design decisions. We conducted testing sessions using the full protocol and prepared questions, ensuring each participant had a clear understanding of the tasks and objectives. All necessary documents, such as consent forms, were completed in accordance with ethical guidelines, as our team was CITI verified. This preparation ensured that the testing process was ethical, professional, and focused on obtaining genuine user feedback.

During testing, participants interacted with the fully functional prototype, which closely mirrored the final app’s experience. This approach allowed us to observe how users engaged with the app in a realistic setting. We paid close attention to their navigation patterns, any points of confusion, and the ease with which they completed tasks. The think-aloud method further enriched our understanding, as users provided real-time commentary on their experiences. This combination of observation and direct feedback allowed us to pinpoint specific areas for improvement that might not have been obvious from internal evaluations alone.

Post-testing, we conducted a thorough analysis of the feedback, identifying recurring issues and positive aspects of the app. This analysis revealed faults and areas where the user experience could be improved, as well as confirming elements that were well-received. The insights gained were instrumental in refining the final design and functionality of Pickup. By addressing these findings, we ensured that the app met user needs more effectively and delivered a smoother, more enjoyable experience.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
