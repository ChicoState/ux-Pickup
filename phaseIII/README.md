# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In this phase, we focused on testing users on how the software ran. We found that before phase 2 we didn't really have a good idea as to what our product was going to look like not only for us, but for consumers as well. We want to find something clean but unique from other products. Besides this, we need a lot of user feedback for our designs and ideas of what Pickup should be. We are constantly going in between being a primarily sports app and being a full fledged app for everything "Gaming". We are also trying not to clutter the interface or make it too complex to use, especially if we are an all-inclusive app for everything gaming. There would be many options for those who want just sports and those who wish to just virtual/tabletop gaming. We found that users really liked the idea of meeting friends and being able to choose skill levels. Going to an event with knowing the amount of people there was a stress reliever for them.

## Methods
Wireframe Refinement and Prototyping:

In the final phase of Pickup’s development, we focused on refining wireframes for a seamless user experience. This involved improving visuals, layout, and interaction design based on usability principles. Iterations helped visualize the app's evolving structure while enhancing user engagement. We added interactivity to static wireframes by creating a working prototype. This allowed us to simulate user interactions and test key features for intuitiveness and accessibility. The prototype helped identify and fix issues early, streamlining development. Through iterative prototyping and feedback, we ensured the design met aesthetic and functional standards. Continuous refinement created a solid foundation for a user-friendly, visually appealing app.

Prototype Testing Protocol:

We developed a protocol with questions and tasks for systematic user testing. This ensured consistent evaluation of navigation, design clarity, and user satisfaction. Clear guidelines helped us identify patterns and compare results effectively. The protocol encouraged users to think aloud, providing insights into their expectations and frustrations. This structured approach reduced bias and allowed us to adapt to real-time feedback, exploring new areas of interest. By following this protocol, we gathered valuable insights to improve the design. Feedback highlighted strengths and weaknesses, helping us refine the app to better meet user needs.

User Testing and Feedback Analysis:

User testing validated our design decisions. Using the protocol, we guided participants through tasks, ensuring ethical standards with consent forms and CITI verification. This preparation ensured professional and unbiased feedback collection. Participants interacted with the functional prototype, providing real-time feedback through think-aloud sessions. We observed navigation, confusion points, and task completion ease to identify areas for improvement. Post-testing analysis revealed key issues and successful elements. These insights helped refine the app’s design, ensuring a smoother, more effective user experience.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

Users appreciated our initial wireframe designs, especially the aesthetics, which they found clean and visually appealing. This validation gave us more insight into the importance of maintaining a streamlined, user-friendly design as we move forward. Analyzed competitor products, identifying clear strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to integrate features while addressing potential downfalls before it is too late. This approach ensures our product continues with a best-practice mindset without inheriting common problems. It is understood that we need clearer goals. To refine our vision, we will focus on solidifying our objectives and developing more in-depth User Stories. With a clearer direction, we can resolve some of the cloudiness that still looms over our target focus, whether we should cater exclusively to sports or expand to include board and video gaming.

## Caveats

A limitation of our testing is the fact that the testing of our cognitive walkthroughs are within the classroom, so the range of the audience is very limited.
Also, since the audience available for the testing is all in the same classroom, which can have a lot of bias mentally on how to navigate the app already.
Although the app is intended for younger audiences since that group is the most active, it would benefit to get a wider age range.
