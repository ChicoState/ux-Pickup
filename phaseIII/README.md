# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods
Wireframe Refinement and Prototyping:
In the final phase of Pickup’s development, we focused on refining wireframes for a seamless user experience. This involved improving visuals, layout, and interaction design based on usability principles. Iterations helped visualize the app's evolving structure while enhancing user engagement. We added interactivity to static wireframes by creating a working prototype. This allowed us to simulate user interactions and test key features for intuitiveness and accessibility. The prototype helped identify and fix issues early, streamlining development. Through iterative prototyping and feedback, we ensured the design met aesthetic and functional standards. Continuous refinement created a solid foundation for a user-friendly, visually appealing app.

Prototype Testing Protocol:
We developed a protocol with questions and tasks for systematic user testing. This ensured consistent evaluation of navigation, design clarity, and user satisfaction. Clear guidelines helped us identify patterns and compare results effectively. The protocol encouraged users to think aloud, providing insights into their expectations and frustrations. This structured approach reduced bias and allowed us to adapt to real-time feedback, exploring new areas of interest. By following this protocol, we gathered valuable insights to improve the design. Feedback highlighted strengths and weaknesses, helping us refine the app to better meet user needs.

User Testing and Feedback Analysis:
User testing validated our design decisions. Using the protocol, we guided participants through tasks, ensuring ethical standards with consent forms and CITI verification. This preparation ensured professional and unbiased feedback collection. Participants interacted with the functional prototype, providing real-time feedback through think-aloud sessions. We observed navigation, confusion points, and task completion ease to identify areas for improvement. Post-testing analysis revealed key issues and successful elements. These insights helped refine the app’s design, ensuring a smoother, more effective user experience.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
