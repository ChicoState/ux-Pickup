# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

This phase we are focusing on refining and honing in on that main idea of an app to find people to play games with. We found that before phase 2 we didn't really have a good idea as to what our product was gonna look like not only for us but for consumers as well. We want to find something that looks clean but feels unique from other products. Other than this we need alot of user feedback for our designs and our ideas of what Pickup should be. We are constantly going in between being a primarily sports app and being a full fledged app for everything "Gaming".

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
