# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

This phase we are focusing on refining and honing in on that main idea of an app to find people to play games with. We found that before phase 2 we didn't really have a good idea as to what our product was gonna look like not only for us but for consumers as well. We want to find something that looks clean but feels unique from other products. Other than this we need alot of user feedback for our designs and our ideas of what Pickup should be. We are constantly going in between being a primarily sports app and being a full fledged app for everything "Gaming". We are also trying not to clutter the interface or make it too complex to use, especially if we are an all inclusive app for everything gaming. There would be many options for those who want just sports and those who want just virtual/tabletop gaming.

## Methods
We conducted more research on users during this sprint to improve our project further. In the last phase, we focused on Competitive Analysis, which involved 3 users, and Heuristic Evaluation, which also involved three users, to research. In this phase, we used a Cognitive Walkthrough, which involved five users, and Informal Feedback, which involved 65 users. By increasing our user base, we increased input to get more valuable feedback.

Cognitive walkthrough took users step by step through our wireframe documentation so the UX team could see any confusion that may arise. Ensuring the user knows where to go for each step without asking for help is necessary to make the product efficient, satisfying, and effective. The users provided feedback on what was easy to do and what questions arose from their use of the wireframes.

Informal feedback was another helpful method, as it had a large user base that gave various opinions. Developers asked a class full of Software Engineering students what they would like the website to have and what features stood out from the competition. The answers to these questions were given back as feedback for the UX team to discuss during this sprint phase.

## Findings
- Cognitive Walkthrough: The feedbacks from the cognitive walkthrough are
mostly positive, aside from some missing features that have not been
implemented yet.
- Informal Feedback: The testers for our product strongly recommend that we
include a sorting/filtering feature into our app, so that they can find what they
want more efficiently. The testers also suggested the use as labels and adding
requirements as options for each of the posts they make.
-  Filters
- Filter by time and location
-Location near me, then being able to filter timeslot
- Filter by event type.
- Labeling for each box in each posts
- Adding requirements to post
- Min/max of people for an event
- Adding a calendar function to the user profile to be able to filter out events
that are during classes/work, like when2meet, but only show the posts that
work in your time frame
- Competitive Analysis: By analyzing similar apps from our potential competitors,
we found out that they generally aim for a similar audience as us, but their UX
was not intuitive enough for people to fully resolve problems if the user has no
prior UX knowledge or entered the wrong input.
- Heuristic Evaluation: Our competitor has many flaws when it comes to their UX
design which leads to a lot of confusion if information is not input correctly into
their required fields.


## Conclusions
Users appreciated our initial; wireframe designs, especially the aesthetics, which they found clean and visually appealing. This validation gave us more isngith into the importance of maintaining a streamlined, user friendly design as we move forward.
Analyzed competitor products, which identified clear strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to integrate features while addressing potential downfalls before its too late. This approach ensures our product continues with a best practice mindset without also inheriting common problems.
Understood that we need clearer goals, to refine our vision we will focus on solidifying our objectives and developing more in-depth User Stories. with a clearer direction, we can resolve some of the cloudedness that still looms on our target focus. Whether we should cater exclusively to sports or expand to include board and video gaming.

## Caveats

- A limitation for our testing is the fact that the testing of our cognitive
walkthroughs are within the classroom, so that the range of audience was very
limited.
- Also due to the fact that the audience available for the testing are all in the same
classroom, which can have a lot of bias mentally on how to navigate the app
already
