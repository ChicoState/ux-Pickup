# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

This phase we are focusing on refining and honing in on that main idea of an app to find people to play games with. We found that before phase 2 we didn't really have a good idea as to what our product was gonna look like not only for us but for consumers as well. We want to find something that looks clean but feels unique from other products. Other than this we need alot of user feedback for our designs and our ideas of what Pickup should be. We are constantly going in between being a primarily sports app and being a full fledged app for everything "Gaming". We are also trying not to clutter the interface or make it too complex to use, especially if we are an all inclusive app for everything gaming. There would be many options for those who want just sports and those who want just virtual/tabletop gaming.

## Methods
While obtaining new findings we performed many impactful methods. Our most personal method was a **Cognitive Walthrough** 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions
Users appreciated our initial; wireframe designs, especially the aesthetics, which they found clean and visually appealing. This validation gave us more isngith into the importance of maintaining a streamlined, user friendly design as we move forward.
Analyzed competitor products, which identified clear strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to integrate features while addressing potential downfalls before its too late. This approach ensures our product continues with a best practice mindset without also inheriting common problems.
Understood that we need clearer goals, to refine our vision we will focus on solidifying our objectives and developing more in-depth User Stories. with a clearer direction, we can resolve some of the cloudedness that still looms on our target focus. Whether we should cater exclusively to sports or expand to include board and video gaming.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
