# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

With Pickup, we are trying to allow users to find people anywhere in the world and near them to play games at any given moment. You can imagine a world in which you **Pickup** your phone and in an instant you can go to a soccer game. This is the power of pickup, we do not see any huge competitors in this market and yet it is something most people would want out of a product. 


## Methods
  While researching for **Pickup**, We analyzed and performed a variety of different research methods to understand better; who our core audience is and what they want to see from us. Starting with **Competitive Analysis**, this was most impactful to the beginning stages of our product. We looked at the top-performing apps in the same space as our own and 
used their apps. This is primarily used to gain a better understanding of how their market works and how can we stand out. Also used it for determining strengths and weaknesses, understanding market trends, and how to create something unique. Each of our competitors were evaluated on a couple of key features: Price, Audience, and Quality. 

  After we understood our place in the market we wanted to discover who our primary audience would be and what they would want from us. This leads us to our next research method which is creating _User Stories._ Creating user stories entails two things, one would be identifying a unique persona, with a name, age, job, etc and the other would be their scenario. Which is a situation our persona is dealing with or is put into. We created about a dozen or so User Stories all with diverse backgrounds and scenarios. An example of one was someone who found themselves to be quite lonely having moved into a new city but with a deep passion for soccer. Which is a perfect user story for our app. When creating our user stories we were looking for 3 key things: What could they gain from our app? How would they find out about it? Would it work for them?

Last but not least *badum tsss*. We performed a Heuristic Evaluation on our top competitor in the space. Our top competitor was an app called **_GOODREC_**, they are a multi-sports pickup game finder for major cities. Once we had our target, we took the 10 Biometrics and evaluated each one on a scale of one through ten. This entailed us going through most of the features of the app for the nitty gritty things. This is a huge step forward regarding the UX experience because it gives us clear markers to evaluate our competitors. What this means is that we can find these and improve upon them in our product. Lastly, we gave them a final ranking out of 100 determining their total score for our evaluation. 




## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!
- Heuristic Evaluation: One crucial aspect to someone using your app is its aesthetics. If an app does not look good or feel good to use, we find an alarming amount of users will drop the product. Avoid falling into this trap.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
